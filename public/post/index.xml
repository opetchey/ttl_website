      <description>Universities are composed of two broad groups of individuals. The managers and the academics. The managers govern and lead; the academics do the teaching and research. Managers tend to view the University as a business, and academics tend to view the University as, well, not a business. (Some of the managers were academics, few of the academics were managers.)
