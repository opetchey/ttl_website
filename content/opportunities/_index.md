## If you might be interested in joining the team...

Immediately below are some of the researchers currently in the team, their research interests, and how they may be able to help you. Then come sections on general masters, PhD, and postdoctoral opportunities.

[Frank Pennekamp](https://frank-pennekamp.info)  I am interested in biotic responses to environmental change from the individual to the ecosystem level. I primarily address my questions with experiments, field studies and statistical/mathematical modeling. While most of my work uses microbial model systems (protists), I am really fond of insects and my goal is to make them the focus of a new line of field-based research. I really enjoy to work at the interface of data and theory and would be happy to hear from people interested in internships, masters studies, phd studies, and postdoctoral research.  [Email Frank](mailto:frank.pennekamp@ieu.uzh.ch)

[Marcel Suleiman](https://www.ieu.uzh.ch/en/staff/member/suleiman_marcel.html) --  My postdoctoral research projects focus on bacterial communities of diverse natural ecosystems, mostly aquatic systems, and how changing environmental conditions affect interplay scenarios within such communities. My work is mainly based in the lab, therefore I would be happy to hear from people interested in lab work and motivated in cultivation of all kinds of bacteria (aerobic, microaerophilic, anaerobic, photosynthetic). If you are interested in internships (minimum 3 month), master studies, or phd studies (co-supervising), feel free to contact me. [Email Marcel](mailto:marcel.suleiman@ieu.uzh.ch)

[Romana Limberger](https://www.uibk.ac.at/limno/personnel/limberger/) -- In my research I am investigating ecological and evolutionary responses of communities to environmental change, using experiments with aquatic protists as model systems. I would be happy to hear from people interested in internships, masters studies, phd studies, and postdoctoral research. [Email Romana](mailto:romana.limberger@uibk.ac.at)

**Rainer Krug** -- I work in the field of scientific programming using R, data and metadata management and workflows, and developing pipelines to automate the pre-processing and analysis of different types of measured data. If you are interested in these topics and would like to do some work with me, as an internship, or part of master, phd, postdoctoral or any other studies, please contact me and we can see if it is feasible. [Email Rainer](mailto:Rainer.Krug@ieu.uzh.ch)

[Anubhav Gupta](https://sites.google.com/view/anubhavgupta) I combine food web modelling and Bayesian statistics to quantify uncertainty in predictions. I am working with the allometric diet breadth model (ADBM) which predicts food web structure, and investigating how the composition and the quantity of different types of food web data affect the model (ADBM)'s predictions. Broadly, I am interested in mathematical modelling and food webs. If you would like to know more or are interested in doing an internship or a master project feel free to contact me. [Email Anubhav](mailto:anubhav.gupta@ieu.uzh.ch)

**Uriah Daugaard** -- In the context of my PhD studies, the focus of my
research currently lies on ecological forecasting and associated
questions such as: (1) What makes certain ecological systems and
measures more predictable than others? (2) Are there general relations
between species or ecosystem characteristics and how well these can be
predicted? (3) How do such relations scale with environmental change,
for instance with warming? To tackle these questions I mainly work with
laboratory based microbial aquatic ecosystems (natural communities
consisting in ciliates, bacteria, algae, flagellates and rotifer
species) but I plan to also use real-world data from Swiss lakes. I'm
also interested in doing side-projects, such as functional response
experiments. Get in touch if you're interested in talking about this
research or in doing an internship or M.Sc. [Email

## Masters

The group participates in the following graduate programmes:

* [Masters in Biology, Ecology](https://www.biologie.uzh.ch/de/Studium/Masterstudium/MasterStudies/Ecology.html)
* [Masters in Biology, Systematics and Evolution](https://www.biologie.uzh.ch/de/Studium/Masterstudium/MasterStudies/SystematicsEvolution.html)
* [Masters in Biology, Animal Behaviour](https://www.biologie.uzh.ch/de/Studium/Masterstudium/MasterStudies/AnimalBehaviour.html)
* [Masters in Environmental Sciences](https://www.ieu.uzh.ch/en/teaching/envsci/master.html)

## PhDs

Please contact a team member listed above if you have an idea for a Ph.D. that you think fits with the research aims of the team (and please consider this [advice about making an effective enquiry]({{< ref "posts/2019-03-03-making-an-effective-enquiry.md" >}})).
If you’re interested in studying for a PhD in Ecology (or related subjects) we have a very strong ecology program, joint with ETH. You can apply to this program, and may then be invited to visit Zurich to meet Professors and groups, and for a short interview. You can also apply directly to Professors. For more information about the ecology program, take a look at [the web page of the ecology phd program](https://www.ieu.uzh.ch/en/teaching/phd/graduate.html). For more information about PhDs in other areas of biology, please take a look at [the web pages of the Life Sciences Zurich Graduate School](https://www.lifescience-graduateschool.uzh.ch/en.html).

## Postdocs

We are always very happy to consider motivated and enthusiastic postdoctoral researchers whose research interests are a good fit with the group’s. Please contact a team member listed above (and please consider this [advice about making an effective enquiry]({{< ref "posts/2019-03-03-making-an-effective-enquiry.md" >}}))
