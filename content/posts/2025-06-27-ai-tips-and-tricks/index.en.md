At our recent group retreat we shared AI tips and tricks:

* Donâ€™t forget all the cool stuff in [Google NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/), including making podcasts to listen to on the train, in the gym, or while doing the laundry.
* We can make agents with [Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/copilot-101/copilot-ai-agents) (depending on your licence with Microsoft), perhaps useful for making chatbots for use in teaching.
* Keep the [ethical](https://milvus.io/ai-quick-reference/what-ethical-concerns-exist-with-llms), [societal](https://cacm.acm.org/news/gauging-societal-impacts-of-large-language-models/), and [environmental](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-76682-6) aspects in mind, and learn about them.
* [Temporary chat](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8914046-temporary-chat-faq) is a useful ChatGPT feature. It provides a clean slate for chats and information is not used for training models.
* [Projects](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10169521-projects-in-chatgpt) in ChatGPT are a useful (may require a paid subscription)
* [Claude allows linking to a GitHub repository](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/10167454-using-the-github-integration); can be useful when getting AI help with a coding project.
* ChatGPT helping in searching 200 paper title and abstracts provided by a search in Web of Science, for most relevant papers.
* Great for getting ideas for the title and or acronym of a paper, proposal, or project.
* Great website for keeping up with AI tools: https://www.oneusefulthing.org/
* Be on the look out for agents that do things for us. E.g., plan and book a holiday, reply to emails, schedule meetings.
