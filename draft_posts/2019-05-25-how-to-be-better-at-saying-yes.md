No end of life, management, and leadership advice focuses on the importance of saying no. People talk about being over-committed because they just can't say no. And that they are working on being better at saying no.

I do not want to be better at saying no. I want to be better at saying YES! And I want everyone else to be better at saying yes. Ultimately, I would like to work and live with people that only every say yes.

How could that be possible?
- the responsibility is with the person asking the question.
- if you are uncertain if the answer will be yes, don't ask.

How can you be certain that the answer will be yes? You have to know the person, familiarise them with the issue, discuss solutions. And be ready and able to walk away from them if it seems they are not interested.

Ask different questions?
How could you help with that?

When you are not asking, i.e. you are telling, just do that.
Point out what needs doing.
