A few things I've written that may be of interest. I wrote them some time ago and could now critique some of the points and arguments, but believe the main themes remain valid.

{{% staticref "old_posts/TheTrophicLink-About_fairness_in_the_workplace.pdf" "newtab" %}}**Fairness at work (PDF).**{{% /staticref %}} The outcome of an incomplete delve into the role of fairness in the workplace.

[**Leadership and competition.**]({{< relref "/posts/2019-03-11-an-academic-in-business-school-and-being-a-better-dad.md" >}}) A perhaps rather preachy piece about what I understand about leadership and competitiveness.

{{% staticref "old_posts/TheTrophicLink _ When should I start giving_.pdf" "newtab" %}}**When to give (PDF)?**{{% /staticref %}} Some thoughts on when during our careers we might start "giving".

[**A University, a Business?**]({{< relref "/posts/2019-03-11-students-are-not-our-customers-they-are-our-products.md" >}}) Ideas about how we could avoid viewing students as customers even if we did view a university as a business.

[**Valuing individuals in team.**]({{< relref "/posts/2019-03-13-valuing-contributions-in-teams.md" >}}) Comments on some challenges when working in teams, and a tool for helping avoid them.
