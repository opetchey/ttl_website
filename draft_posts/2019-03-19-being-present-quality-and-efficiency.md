I'm continually inspired by two Subway employees. They were *totally* engrossed in a game of who could make the most perfect looking sub---to make a sub even better looking that in the photos above the counter (real Sandwich Artists eh!). They were making great subs, were having fun, were bringing customers into the game, and made that subway a great place to be. They were 100% present in what they were doing.

In contrast, I sometimes see colleagues in meetings working on their laptop, doing stuff unrelated to the meeting. They are perhaps 90% absent from the meeting. I once learned that one such person felt compelled to work during the meeting... compelled by the many tasks they felt pressing in on them. That they themselves did not particularly like being absent(-minded) while physically present. They themselves suggested it might be better to be *present* in meetings that one decides/agrees to attend.

If you drive, you've likely had the experience of arriving somewhere with little idea or memory of events and places passed during the drive there. You were physically present, part of your brain was present, but a large part was off somewhere else.

If you ever realised you have no idea what the person you're in conversation with just said, then you in that moment experienced the result of being absent. It may be that you were distracted and thinking about something else completely. Or that you were thinking about something interesting the person just said.

What has this presence got to do with quality and efficiency? My understanding (which is continually developing) is that presence, and the things that we can do to increase our presence, have very strong and beneficial effects on the quality of the things we do, and the efficiency with which we do them.

If you have a mountain to climb, what is the best way of doing so? You could think about how beautiful the view will be, the sense of accomplishment, and other positive consequences of reaching the summit. You could use these promised rewards as motivation. Another approach is to focus on every step being the best possible step you have ever taken. The former approach is a not-so-present approach. The latter approach is the very-present approach.

Flow as a state of highly stable presence. Lovely when it happens, and we can do things to promote states of flow. But more often our presence is continually 

What should we do in meetings that we are obliged to attend, though have little interest in attending? One answer is to find ways of being interested and present.

Key for high productivity and efficiency.

Include examples of not being absent.
- driving and having no recollection of places we must have passed.
- being in a meeting and emailing.
- thinking about something else while someone talks with us.
- allowing distractions to persist

Distractions will always occur.
