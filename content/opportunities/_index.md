## If you might be interested in joining the team...

Immediately below are some of the researchers currently in the team, their research interests, and how they may be able to help you. Then come sections on general masters, PhD, and postdoctoral opportunities.

[Frank Pennekamp](https://frank-pennekamp.info)  I am interested in biotic responses to environmental change from the individual to the ecosystem level. I primarily address my questions with experiments, field studies and statistical/mathematical modeling. While most of my work uses microbial model systems (protists), I am really fond of insects and my goal is to make them the focus of a new line of field-based research. I really enjoy to work at the interface of data and theory and would be happy to hear from people interested in internships, masters studies, phd studies, and postdoctoral research.  [Email Frank](mailto:frank.pennekamp@ieu.uzh.ch)

[Marcel Suleiman](https://www.ieu.uzh.ch/en/staff/member/suleiman_marcel.html) --  My postdoctoral research projects focus on bacterial communities of diverse natural ecosystems, mostly aquatic systems, and how changing environmental conditions affect interplay scenarios within such communities. My work is mainly based in the lab, therefore I would be happy to hear from people interested in lab work and motivated in cultivation of all kinds of bacteria (aerobic, microaerophilic, anaerobic, photosynthetic). If you are interested in internships (minimum 3 month), master studies, or phd studies (co-supervising), feel free to contact me. [Email Marcel](mailto:marcel.suleiman@ieu.uzh.ch)

[Romana Limberger](https://www.uibk.ac.at/limno/personnel/limberger/) -- In my research I am investigating ecological and evolutionary responses of communities to environmental change, using experiments with aquatic protists as model systems. I would be happy to hear from people interested in internships, masters studies, phd studies, and postdoctoral research. [Email Romana](mailto:romana.limberger@uibk.ac.at)

[Sofia van Moorsel](https://www.sofiavanmoorsel.com)  I am a Postdoc interested in rapid evolution and how it influences community stability and functioning. I love doing experiments in the field, in the glasshouse, or in the lab with a number of different organisms, both aquatic and terrestrial. Currently, I'm researching whether adaptation to the community context and environmental conditions can modify a communities' response to novel stressful environments. I would be happy to hear from people interested in internships, research stays, or masters studies! I especially encourage underrepresented minorities and women to reach out. [Email Sofia](mailto:sofia.vanmoorsel@ieu.uzh.ch)

**Rainer Krug** -- I work in the field of scientific programming using R, data and metadata management and workflows, and developing pipelines to automate the pre-processing and analysis of different types of measured data. If you are interested in these topics and would like to do some work with me, as an internship, or part of master, phd, postdoctoral or any other studies, please contact me and we can see if it is feasible.

## Masters

The group participates in the following graduate programmes:

* [Masters in Biology, Ecology](https://www.biologie.uzh.ch/de/Studium/Masterstudium/MasterStudies/Ecology.html)
* [Masters in Biology, Systematics and Evolution](https://www.biologie.uzh.ch/de/Studium/Masterstudium/MasterStudies/SystematicsEvolution.html)
* [Masters in Biology, Animal Behaviour](https://www.biologie.uzh.ch/de/Studium/Masterstudium/MasterStudies/AnimalBehaviour.html)
* [Masters in Environmental Sciences](https://www.ieu.uzh.ch/en/teaching/envsci/master.html)

## PhDs

Please contact a team member listed above if you have an idea for a Ph.D. that you think fits with the research aims of the team (and please consider this [advice about making an effective enquiry]({{< ref "posts/2019-03-03-making-an-effective-enquiry.md" >}})).
If you’re interested in studying for a PhD in Ecology (or related subjects) we have a very strong ecology program, joint with ETH. You can apply to this program, and may then be invited to visit Zurich to meet Professors and groups, and for a short interview. You can also apply directly to Professors. For more information about the ecology program, take a look at [the web page of the ecology phd program](https://www.ieu.uzh.ch/en/teaching/phd/graduate.html). For more information about PhDs in other areas of biology, please take a look at [the web pages of the Life Sciences Zurich Graduate School](https://www.lifescience-graduateschool.uzh.ch/en.html).

## Postdocs

We are always very happy to consider motivated and enthusiastic postdoctoral researchers whose research interests are a good fit with the group’s. Please contact a team member listed above (and please consider this [advice about making an effective enquiry]({{< ref "posts/2019-03-03-making-an-effective-enquiry.md" >}}))
