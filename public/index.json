How can we show how integrative is a body of research, and investigate if it has added-value?\nThese are difficult questions that we don\u0026rsquo;t have all the answers to. Here we give a few possibilities based on the corpus of publications produced by a research programme aimed at creating added-value via promoting integrative research. We visualise characteristics of that corpus of publications, and compare to a reference corpus of publications arising from research that may or may not have included integrative research. (And the gory details of how we did this are provided below.)\nThe example below involves the corpus of publications arising from the University or Zurich Research Priority Programme in Global Change and Biodiversity (URPP GCB). The reference corpus is from related research fields for similar time period at University of Zurich (exact specification in the gory details section).\n The network of co-authors in the URPP GCB corpus.   Figure 1 shows the tightly connected co-authorship network of 20 of the researchers in the URPP GCB. It shows that in terms of collaboration there is a great deal of integration. The number of co-authors in the URPP GCB corpus is about 20% greater than in the reference, though only by about one author on average (Figure 2). The number of times articles were cited is about 30% greater in the URPP GCB corpus than in the reference (Figure 2).\n Comparison of number of authors per article and number of times articles are cited between in the reference corpus and the focal (URPP GCB) corpus.

(Actually, we used the lovely Add items by identifier Zotero button, and added by DOI.)\nGet information about your corpus from WoS We will get information from WoS on the specific papers in our corpus by searching WoS for the DOIs of the articles in the corpus. To do this, we want to get text, which we\u0026rsquo;ll paste into the WoS search term field, of the following nature :\n02/ECY.2003 OR 16/J.ECOCOM.2016.12.005 OR 16/J.RSE.2014.11.014 OR 02/ECY.1748 OR 16/J.COSUST.2018.04.016 OR 02/ECE3.1186 OR 93/FEMSEC/FIV066 OR 11/ELE.12443\nTo get this text:\n## install the following if required library(bibliometrix) library(tidyverse) library(circlize) library(wordcloud2) library(cowplot)   Highlight the papers in Zotero that are your corpus. Use the File -\u0026gt; Export Library\u0026hellip; tool in Zotero, choose BibTex format, leave all boxes unchecked, leave Character encoding as Unicode (UTF-8), click OK, and choose the location and filename. We named the file from_zotero.bib and saved it to our Desktop (referred to on a Mac by ~/Desktop/).

Copy the text, and paste it into the search term window of WoS Basic Search. Select DOI as the item being searched for. Hit the Search button. You may get fewer results from WoS than DOIs you entered. At time of writing this article we had 164 DOIs, or which WoS found 138. We didn\u0026rsquo;t look in great detail at which were not found and why they were not. Get data out of WoS by using the Save to Other File Formats option. Specify the numbers of the records (we chose 1 through 138, i.e. all of them) (If you have lots, you may have to do this multiple times, as WoS has a limit of 500 records it will save in one go.). Select Record Content to be Full Record and Cited References, and File Format to be BibTex. Click Send and you should soon get a file savedrecs.bib (it should appear in the folder where you downloads usually go). Rename the downloaded file to something meaningful, e.g. we named ours to focal_corpus_from_WoS.bib.

I have now, and consequently have enhanced ability and confidence to lead teams, to navigate them through uncertain times, and, perhaps most importantly, to be a better dad.\nDuring spring 2016 took part in the Fast Track Advanced Management Programme of Ashridge Executive Education. The Programme has two modules, each involves a one-week residential course at Ashridge, near Berkhamstead, just outside London.\nWicked problems in a VUCA world The industrial revolution led to times characterised by relative predictability. Design a television, make TVs, sell TVs, redesign TVs, make TVs, sell TVs. Manage the business to do that. That worked for at least half a century.\nA foundation of leadership education at Ashridge is that we now live a VUCA world of wicked problems. VUCA is volatile, unpredictable, complex and ambiguous. Things will change, and we can´t predict how or when. Wicked problems have no single solution. Even the challenges we foresee will escape any single simple solution.\nIn such a world, leaders must draw on and nurture creativity. Team members need the high intrinsic motivation that comes from autonomy, from purpose, and from seeking mastery. Extrinsic motivation (e.g., performance related pay) and command-and-control leadership extinguish intrinsic motivation and the high levels of creativity arising.\nThe research team I lead tackles wicked problems; in particular how can we more accurately forecast ecological dynamics, such as fish stocks ten years from now. So while I was familiar with the territory, I hadn’t connected it to leadership. Ashridge helped make that connection, and in doing so helped crystalise in me a personal leadership style that resonates with my research, that will bring out the best in team members, and which I understand and can develop.\nRunning a business The programme included a business simulation taking place at the rate of one simulated year every real hour. My small team of classmates competed against four teams of other classmates. We designed, marketed, advertised, and sold retail products. The presence of the other teams created uncertainties about the outcome of our actions. We didn´t know what types of product they might produce, how hard they would advertise, the state of their finances. It’s a great testament to the programme that I played a key role in our company winning the competition (there were only four of us in the company, so we all played a key role).\nWhile I’m happy that my team won, I think more often about the mistakes we made, about how we were successful, and what other teams did differently to us. As it turned out, we’d been making a rather serious mistake for the entire simulation, and had it continued longer, we probably would not have won.\nThe most significant meta-lesson I took from the simulation was about what drives me. After we won, a classmate commented to me that I was probably highly competitive. I realised I don’t care about whether I am or not, because it is unimportant. Instead, I care about learning new things so that I can perform better than I could, about being creative, and about seeing others (and myself) attack the hardest problems we can find. It is nice, but for me relatively unimportant, that such behaviour often creates the greatest chance of winning.\nCollaborating and challenging Perhaps my greatest concern was how I would get on with my classmates. Almost all were from the business world: managing director, development director, strategy director, vice president, financial controller, from a diversity of business sectors. How would I compare to them, would I make a fool of myself, what would they think of me? I was stepping way out of my familiar ivory tower.\nI was challenged again and again. I had to ask what were P\u0026amp;L, KPIs, and B2B / B2C*. I probably said some stupid things. But I never felt any judgement from instructors or classmates. Quite the opposite. They were enthusiastic, supportive, open, observant, creative, and fun. The outstanding learning experience created by the excellent instructors was highly collaborative and challenged us all. We learned at least as much from each other as we did from the instructors. It gives me great optimism that these leaders in the business world focus on success through building supportive, safe, and authentic relationships.\nThat sounds rather too warm and fluffy for business folk. True, none of my classmates were bankers, though one was a lawyer. Joking aside, all were highly driven, ambitious, and at times challenging. My optimism comes from seeing so many folk showing, believing, and demonstrating that giving is a powerful and probably necessary partner of drive, ambition, and disruption.\nBeing a better dad Before kids, life was relatively predictable and controllable. Get up at 7am, make breakfast, eat breakfast, read the paper, walk to work, work, go home, sleep, repeat. Now, none of those are certain: the arrival of my kids created volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. There are no simple or single obvious solutions to the challenges they create. And they themselves will grow up, live, and, with the leadership I may give, thrive in a VUCA world of wicked problems.\n\u0026ndash; Owen Petchey, April 2016\n","date":1552262400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552262400,"objectID":"0e00ad65a3f036b94f15d6ee5525f610","permalink":"/posts/an-academic-in-business-school-and-being-a-better-dad/","publishdate":"2019-03-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/posts/an-academic-in-business-school-and-being-a-better-dad/","section":"posts","summary":"I’d never had formal management or leadership training, never been schooled in negotiation or influencing, and never run a business.

It is tempting to view the students as the customer. Though one might consider this accurate from a transactional perspective, it is a deeply disfunctional perspective.
