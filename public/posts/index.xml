      <description>Whether you are enquiring about available positions (and perhaps funding) or have a funding scheme that you would like to apply for (to be held in Owenâ€™s group), there are a few things you can do to make it more likely that you get a useful response from Owen, or any other potential supporter.
 Include your CV with your enquiry, including names of any previous supervisors. Include a short statement of research interests and motivation, highlighting any outstanding acheivements.</description>
