From LSZGS:
How to interview for a PhD position (includes material developed by Karin Meier: meier@imsb.biol.ethz.ch)
During your interviews there are a few topics besides the actual research project that you should discuss with your potential PI. Those questions and the respective answers will help you get a more comprehensive impression of the lab environment and can potentially help you make a decision for one lab or another. The checklist below should give you an impression of the questions that you should ask during your interview – either ask your potential PI directly or various lab members.
This list should also help you make up your own mind and think about what is important for you. The interviews are not just a way for PIs to find a PhD student but also an opportunity for you to find a good match. Remember, an interview should be a discussion among equals, and you are expected to take that seriously and ask the questions that will help you make a decision. Do not be afraid to ask your potential PI probing questions.
Topics to be discussed with the lab head:
❏ After the interview you should have some clarity of what the first year of your PhD would look like
and what tangible outcome you can expect. Ask specific questions to get information about that
point.
❏ What is the expected/preferred level of interaction? You should leave the office with a more or
less clear understanding on how this interaction would work.
Topics to be discussed with members of the lab:
❏ How and when to best contact your PI and other PIs (not only to report on successes, but in
particular when difficulties arise)
❏ Level of guidance (regularly scheduled meetings with PI vs. on-demand)
❏ Lab organization: group meetings (how often and what is the format), journal clubs
❏ Typical length of the PhD, and rules for extending the PhD time
❏ Practical arrangements for arranging/approving vacation time
❏ Responsibility and expectations regarding collaborations
Factors to consider besides the topic and lab atmosphere:
❏ Level of supervision you need/expect and how proactive you actually want to be
❏ Big vs. small lab (and how that matches your preferred way of working)
❏ To which extent are you willing to develop your own project rather than taking on a fully predefined
project?
❏ Responsibility and expectations regarding teaching and supervision of semester and master
students
❏ Approach to conference participation and how it will be funded
