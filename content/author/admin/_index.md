Owen has also used R for nearly 20 years, and has particular expertise in teaching beginners, multivariate statistics, spatial data, programming, maximum likelihood estimation, and visualisation (i.e., nice graphs!). His research focuses on the causes and consequences of extinctions in a changing world. His group performs experiments with microbial communities, models the structure of food webs, analyses variation in biodiversity, and does fieldwork in Iceland, the UK, and Switzerland.
