Solutions for some of the problems above:\n Use Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT Term) with degree of contribution (lead, equal, supporting); report this in publications. Team accessible list of contributions. Tracked evolution of contributions, from intended to actual / final. Transparent and flexible method for translating actual / final contributions into authorship order. Contributor responsibility for recording their own contributions(?).

I have now, and consequently have enhanced ability and confidence to lead teams, to navigate them through uncertain times, and, perhaps most importantly, to be a better dad.\nDuring spring 2016 took part in the Fast Track Advanced Management Programme of Ashridge Executive Education. The Programme has two modules, each involves a one-week residential course at Ashridge, near Berkhamstead, just outside London.\nWicked problems in a VUCA world The industrial revolution led to times characterised by relative predictability. Design a television, make TVs, sell TVs, redesign TVs, make TVs, sell TVs. Manage the business to do that. That worked for at least half a century.\nA foundation of leadership education at Ashridge is that we now live a VUCA world of wicked problems. VUCA is volatile, unpredictable, complex and ambiguous. Things will change, and we can´t predict how or when. Wicked problems have no single solution. Even the challenges we foresee will escape any single simple solution.\nIn such a world, leaders must draw on and nurture creativity. Team members need the high intrinsic motivation that comes from autonomy, from purpose, and from seeking mastery. Extrinsic motivation (e.g., performance related pay) and command-and-control leadership extinguish intrinsic motivation and the high levels of creativity arising.\nThe research team I lead tackles wicked problems; in particular how can we more accurately forecast ecological dynamics, such as fish stocks ten years from now. So while I was familiar with the territory, I hadn’t connected it to leadership. Ashridge helped make that connection, and in doing so helped crystalise in me a personal leadership style that resonates with my research, that will bring out the best in team members, and which I understand and can develop.\nRunning a business The programme included a business simulation taking place at the rate of one simulated year every real hour. My small team of classmates competed against four teams of other classmates. We designed, marketed, advertised, and sold retail products. The presence of the other teams created uncertainties about the outcome of our actions. We didn´t know what types of product they might produce, how hard they would advertise, the state of their finances. It’s a great testament to the programme that I played a key role in our company winning the competition (there were only four of us in the company, so we all played a key role).\nWhile I’m happy that my team won, I think more often about the mistakes we made, about how we were successful, and what other teams did differently to us. As it turned out, we’d been making a rather serious mistake for the entire simulation, and had it continued longer, we probably would not have won.\nThe most significant meta-lesson I took from the simulation was about what drives me. After we won, a classmate commented to me that I was probably highly competitive. I realised I don’t care about whether I am or not, because it is unimportant. Instead, I care about learning new things so that I can perform better than I could, about being creative, and about seeing others (and myself) attack the hardest problems we can find. It is nice, but for me relatively unimportant, that such behaviour often creates the greatest chance of winning.\nCollaborating and challenging Perhaps my greatest concern was how I would get on with my classmates. Almost all were from the business world: managing director, development director, strategy director, vice president, financial controller, from a diversity of business sectors. How would I compare to them, would I make a fool of myself, what would they think of me? I was stepping way out of my familiar ivory tower.\nI was challenged again and again. I had to ask what were P\u0026amp;L, KPIs, and B2B / B2C*. I probably said some stupid things. But I never felt any judgement from instructors or classmates. Quite the opposite. They were enthusiastic, supportive, open, observant, creative, and fun. The outstanding learning experience created by the excellent instructors was highly collaborative and challenged us all. We learned at least as much from each other as we did from the instructors. It gives me great optimism that these leaders in the business world focus on success through building supportive, safe, and authentic relationships.\nThat sounds rather too warm and fluffy for business folk. True, none of my classmates were bankers, though one was a lawyer. Joking aside, all were highly driven, ambitious, and at times challenging. My optimism comes from seeing so many folk showing, believing, and demonstrating that giving is a powerful and probably necessary partner of drive, ambition, and disruption.\nBeing a better dad Before kids, life was relatively predictable and controllable. Get up at 7am, make breakfast, eat breakfast, read the paper, walk to work, work, go home, sleep, repeat. Now, none of those are certain: the arrival of my kids created volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. There are no simple or single obvious solutions to the challenges they create. And they themselves will grow up, live, and, with the leadership I may give, thrive in a VUCA world of wicked problems.\n\u0026ndash; Owen Petchey, April 2016\n","date":1552262400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552262400,"objectID":"0e00ad65a3f036b94f15d6ee5525f610","permalink":"/posts/an-academic-in-business-school-and-being-a-better-dad/","publishdate":"2019-03-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/posts/an-academic-in-business-school-and-being-a-better-dad/","section":"posts","summary":"I’d never had formal management or leadership training, never been schooled in negotiation or influencing, and never run a business.

Managers tend to view the University as a business, and academics tend to view the University as, well, not a business. (Some of the managers were academics, few of the academics were managers.)\nWhen a viewing a University as a Business, the question “who are our customers” quickly arises. It is tempting to view the students as the customer. Though one might consider this accurate from a transactional perspective, it is a deeply disfunctional perspective. A customer-provider relationship is not easily compatible with a good teach/mentor–student relationship. In particular, students-as-customers is not conducive to students taking responsibility for their learning. Perhap this is why it is quite unpalatable to many teachers.\nSo don´t view the student as the customer. Don\u0026rsquo;t even think of a University as a Business. But if you really really want to apply a business perspective to a University (and I believe there are important reasons for doing so), view the student as the product, and their future employer as the customer.\nThe University takes in relatively raw materials (new students) and transforms them into valuable products (graduates) by adding value (knowledge, skills, attitudes, relationships). These graduates have attributes (the product specification), and these are advertised to potential employers by their degree name, courses taken, and grade achieved. The attractiveness of the product (graduate) to the customer (the potential employer) is determined by match of desired and advertised skills (a match between employer desires and the employers perception of the product) , match between advertised and actual skills (underselling or overselling represent lack of match), and of brand perception (not all University degrees are regarded equally).\n","date":1552262400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552262400,"objectID":"42974523cb8987b4d3dbc170526bff5d","permalink":"/posts/students-are-not-our-customers-they-are-our-products/","publishdate":"2019-03-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/posts/students-are-not-our-customers-they-are-our-products/","section":"posts","summary":"Universities are composed of two broad groups of individuals.

The functions are updated to account for the development to FD we published in 2006.\nExample 1  Get the code and example datasets. Gain an understanding of how to use R. Use the dist and hclust functions to calculate a dendrogram from a trait matrix. Paste the Xtree function into R. Use it to transform the object returned by hclust into an object from which total branch is easy to calculate. The object returned by Xtree is a list containing a species by branch matrix (H1) and a branch length vector (h2) (see here. Follow the methods in Petchey Gaston (2002) to get FD from H1 and h2. The FD.example.1.r file contains an example of using R to calculate the FD of a random community as it loses species; just paste the text into R. (Remember to paste in the Xtree function!)  FD Example 2 This example demonstrates what people have been asking about some: how to calculate the FD of communities that have different compositions, and see if those measures of FD correlate with a particular measure of ecosystem process (or community property).\nAlways use three data files as the foundation of these types of analysis. Each is created in xl, saved in xl, and saved as a comma delimited text file (extension .csv) because these are easily read into R. You should download all of these files to a particular directory. (Actually, you really need only the csv files.) The files are:\n The species by trait matrix: species.traits.xls (Excel file) or species.traits.csv(csv file). Here, the first column contains the names of the species and the remaining columns the traits.
