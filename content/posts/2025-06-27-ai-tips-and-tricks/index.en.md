At our recent group retreat we shared AI tips and tricks:

* Donâ€™t forget all the cool stuff in Google NotebookLM, including making podcasts to listen to on the train, in the gym, or while doing the laundry.
* We can make agents with Copilot, perhaps useful for making chatbots for use in teaching.
* Keep the ethical, social, and environmental aspects in mind, and learn about them.
* Temporary chat is a useful ChatGPT feature. It provides a clean slate for chats and information is not used for training models.
* Projects in ChatGPT are a useful.
* Claude allows linking to a GitHub repository; can be useful when getting AI help with a coding project.
* ChatGPT helping in searching 200 paper title and abstracts provided by a search in Web of Science, for most relevant papers.
* Great for getting ideas for the title and or acronym of a paper, proposal, or project.
* Great website for keeping up with AI tools: https://www.oneusefulthing.org/
* Be on the look out for Agents that do things for us. E.g., plan and book a holiday, reply to emails, schedule meetings.
