Just so you know, here are some things I explicitly agree with my staff:
- the minimum frequency of meetings
- who is responsible for arranging the meetings
- how communication will happen
- how much notice

Within the context of me committing to providing quality service to my staff, the answers are often:
- once per month
- the staff member
- direct (e.g. not via broadcast)

I also make staff aware of the negative relationship between the quality of the service I provide them with and the amount of time they allow me to provide that service.
