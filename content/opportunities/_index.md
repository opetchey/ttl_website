* [Masters in Biology, Ecology](https://www.biologie.uzh.ch/de/Studium/Masterstudium/MasterStudies/Ecology.html)
* [Masters in Biology, Systematics and Evolution](https://www.biologie.uzh.ch/de/Studium/Masterstudium/MasterStudies/SystematicsEvolution.html)

## PhDs

Please contact Owen if you have an idea for a Ph.D. that you think fits with the research aims of the team (and please consider this [advice about making an effective enquiry]({{< ref "posts/2019-03-03-making-an-effective-enquiry.md" >}})).
If you’re interested in studying for a PhD in Ecology (or related subjects) we have a very strong ecology program, joint with ETH. You can apply to this program, and may then be invited to visit Zurich to meet Professors and groups, and for a short interview. You can also apply directly to Professors. For more information about the ecology program, take a look at [the web page of the ecology phd program](https://www.ieu.uzh.ch/en/teaching/phd/graduate.html). For more information about PhDs in other areas of biology, please take a look at [the web pages of the Life Sciences Zurich Graduate School](https://www.lifescience-graduateschool.uzh.ch/en.html).

## Postdocs

We are always very happy to consider motivated and enthusiastic postdoctoral researchers whose research interests are a good fit with the group’s. Please contact Owen (and please consider this [advice about making an effective enquiry]({{< ref "posts/2019-03-03-making-an-effective-enquiry.md" >}}))
